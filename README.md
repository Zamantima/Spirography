# Spirography
Description
The Spirograph project is a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics library to create mesmerizing spirograph patterns. 
A spirograph is a geometric drawing toy that produces mathematical curves known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. 
This program generates colorful spirograph designs by drawing circles with varying radii and colors.

Usage
To create your own spirograph designs, follow these steps:

Run the Python script.
The Turtle graphics window will appear.
The program will draw a series of circles with varying radii and colors.
You can modify the spirograph pattern by changing the gap_size parameter in the spirograph function. The gap_size determines the angle between each circle in degrees.
To exit the program, simply close the Turtle graphics window.
